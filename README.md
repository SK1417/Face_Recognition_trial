# Face_Recognition_trial

So, this project was meant to be an educative one for me. Now the facenet model is a model released by google, that achieves 
predictions by maximising distance between parameters of unrelated photos, and minimising distance between parameters of 
related ones. The model helps to predict these parameters. 

Issues:

1) Not enough test photos were provided. Thus predictions were far away from expected threshold values.
